# Brain-Cancer-Prediction

## Overview
Brain cancer is a serious medical condition that requires early and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify MRI brain images into three categories:
- **Brain Glioma**
- **Brain Menin**
- **Brain Tumor**

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of MRI scans and achieves high accuracy in detecting these cancer types.

---

## Features
- Classification of MRI images into three categories (Glioma, Meningioma, Tumor).
- High accuracy using deep learning-based CNN architecture.
- Visualization of training vs. test accuracy and loss.
- Confusion matrix to evaluate classification performance.
- Ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (Deep Learning framework)
- **Keras** (Model building and training)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Performance metrics and evaluation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development environment)
